INSTALL

Open a terminal in this folder and run:

$ sudo make install

if you want to install it in another place you can use the DESTDIR argument

$ sudo make install DESTDIR=dir_you_want_use

but it's strongly unrecommended

REMOVE

if you have used the default destdir (sudo make install), simply use:

$ sudo make clean

if you have used the DESTDIR=dir_you_want_use:

$ sudo make clean DESTDIR=dir_you_want_use
